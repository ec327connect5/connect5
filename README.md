# connect5
Connect5 is our take on the game Gomoku.

Connect5 is a two player game with simple rules. The game is easy to pick up, but has a high skill ceiling and a lot of techniques and strategies to 
learn and master. Our version of the game will alternate between two players. Each player will simply play one tile at a time. Players will continue to place tiles one at a 
time until one player links five of their own tiles together vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.

To build the game on your own Android Studio, simply download the code provided and open the folder with Android Studio. Then, build and launch the game on the emulator.

Have fun playing!
